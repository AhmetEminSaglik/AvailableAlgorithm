# AvailableAlgorithm
This project is created to use in [TestAlgorithm Project](https://github.com/AhmetEminSaglik/TestAlgorithm).
<br>The purpose of this project is to get available sort, and search algorithms with the data structure.

<br>For instance, ArrayList is suitable for selection sort and linear search. But hashmap is not suitable with selection sort and linear search.
Hashmap is suitable with only its own search algorithm.
